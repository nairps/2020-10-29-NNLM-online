<h3>Spreadsheets</h3>
  <p>
Spreadsheets are useful for data entry and data organization, and some
subsetting and sorting of the data as well as getting an overview of the
data. To interact with spreadsheets, we can use
<a href="https://www.libreoffice.org">LibreOffice</a>,
<a href="https://products.office.com/en-us/excel">Microsoft Excel</a>,
<a href="https://www.gnumeric.org">Gnumeric</a>,
 or other programs.
Commands may differ a bit between programs, but general ideas for
thinking about spreadsheets is the same.

For this lesson, if you don't have a spreadsheet program already, you
can use <a href="https://www.libreoffice.org">LibreOffice</a>. It's a free, open
source spreadsheet program.
